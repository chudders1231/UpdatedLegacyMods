## **About The Project**

This project aims to slowly port older legacy mods to nautilus that i have permission to do so. Hopefully this collection will grow and become a small but powerful one stop shop for easy-to-access subnautica mods that have been updated to support the growth and development of Nautilus.

Keep an eye out on the Subnautica Modding discord for test builds, and will hopefully add them to Submodica when the mod has the necessary polish.

## **Prerequisites**
There are some mods that the updated versions will need to work, and some are not necessary but highly recommended. Please download the relevant mods for the game you're modding whether it be Subnautica or Below Zero as not all mods work with both. BepInEx Tweaks works with both for example so you can use the mod in both.

### **Required**
| Mod  | Information | SN | BZ |
| - | - | - | - |
| **BepInEx pack for Subnautica** | BepInEx is the framework that allows us to mod Subnautica, and this pack is tailored for a positive Subnautica modding experience. | [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1108) | [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/344) |
| **Nautilus** | Nautilus is an incredible library with the goal to make mod development quick, easy, efficient, and scalable. | [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1262) | [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/373) |

### **Highly Recommended**
| Mod  | Information | SN | BZ |
| - | - | - | - |
| **BepInEx Tweaks** | Due to the nature of modding, some mods break when backing out of a save and requires a restart. This mod fixes this and many other issues relating to subnautica modding. | [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1104) | [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1104) |

## **Updated Mods**
| Mod | Description | SN | BZ |
| - | - | - | - |
| [Autosort Lockers](https://github.com/chudders1231/UpdatedLegacyMods/tree/master/AutosortLockers)| Automatically sort and distribute items to designated lockers throughout your base. | TBD | TBD |


## **Autosort Lockers**
This mod was originally created by RandyKnapp and has created some powerful and well-polished mods. It provides an autosorting locker than takes items, and delivers them to recepticles based on your choice of filters.

### **Features**

- Autosorting to both wall lockers, and standing lockers
- Wall locker recepticle
- Standing locker recepticle
- Customise the colour of the locker and it's panel

### **Default Usage**
Build yourself a nice little base, and build the <span style="color: red;">Autosorter</span> on the wall. Follow that up with building a <span style="color: Lime">Autosort Recepticle</span> anywhere in the base.

You can customise the filters on the recepticle by either the item name, or categories.

Feel free to unload your inventory, or your Prawn suit for that matter into the autosorter, and watch it sort the items for you.

If you want to edit the filters for the mod, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/chudders1231/UpdatedLegacyMods/wiki/Autosort-Lockers#filter-entries). The full list of available `TechTypes` is in a table at the bottom.

## Developer Information
If you would like to add your own items to categories, add new categories, or add your items to the individual items list, refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/chudders1231/UpdatedLegacyMods/wiki/Autosort-Lockers#developers-adding-items-categories-or-individual-items-at-runtime).

## **Roadmap**
This project will be ever changing and will be updated with new mods, and new versions of each mod with new features, optimisations, and bug fixes. Below are planned changes and updates for each mod to keep an eye out for when submitting ideas.

### <u>Autosort Lockers Roadmap</u>
- [x] Update to the living large update
- [x] Filter editing and new filter additions
- [x] Auto unloading locker for vehicle storage
- [ ] Optimisation and project trimming
- [ ] In-Game configuration
